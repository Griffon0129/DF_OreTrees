# DF_OreTrees
This is a mod for Dwarf Fortress that will add ore trees to the game.  Made using v0.44.09.




When the tree is chopped it'll drop wood that functions like wood, but you can also smelt it into different metals.




To use: copy the contenets of all the files to the approperate files in Dwarf Fortress raws.
Also don't forget to add [PERMITTED_REACTION:MAKE_IRONWOOD_BARS] for example to the entity_default.txt file so that certain civilizations can actually smelt the ore tree wood into bars.




I plan to add several other tree types, at minium, one tree per metal type.
